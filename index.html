				<p>I am currently 21 years old, and live in Wichita, Kansas. I'm a very open-minded person, and do everything I can to push myself to new heights, each and every day. I work full-time for Dish Network as a Satellite Technician. For Dish, I've been working about a year and half now. In my spare time; I have many hobbies, including teaching myself how to build websites, how to fix hardware issues on computers, and how to play guitar.</p>
