				<p>I am currently 21 years old, and live in Wichita, Kansas. I'm a very open-minded person, and do everything I can to push myself to new heights, each and every day. I work full-time for Dish Network as a Satellite Technician. For Dish, I've been working about a year and half now. In my spare time, I have many hobbies.</p>

				<p>I went to college at Cowley County Community College. Unfortunately; I made some decisions in my first semester that affected my grades quite drastically, and lead to me dropping out at the end of my first semester.</p>

				<p>While some may think of that as a negative aspect of my life, I look at nearly every decision I've ever made in a positive light.
