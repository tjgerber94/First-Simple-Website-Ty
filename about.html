			<p>I went to college at Cowley County Community College. Unfortunately; I made some decisions in my first semester that affected my grades quite drastically, and lead to me dropping out at the end of my first semester. After dropping out, I seemed to constantly jump from job to job for about 2 years. Eventually, I got on the right track and started to show more consistency in my job history. After starting to work for Dish, aspects of my life have changed. I've become a money-minded person, and have started to pay off debts and built budgets.</p>

			<p>While some may think of that as a negative aspect of my life, I look at nearly every decision I've ever made in a positive light. If I hadn't gone through some of the things I've gone through, I feel that I wouldn't be the person I am today. All in all, I've become a much better person, and have learned much more due to all the "mistakes" I've made.</p>

			<p>Some of my achievements that I take pride in are; teaching myself how to build websites, working full-time and still being able to achieve my goals. I built my Dad's website, using WordPress as a base; but doing all the CSS and customizations myself.</p>
